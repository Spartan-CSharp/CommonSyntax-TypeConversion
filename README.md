# CommonSyntax-TypeConversion
The homework from the Lesson 4, Type Conversion, of Module 2, Common Syntax, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to capture a user's age from the Console and then identify how old they were in the year 2000. If they were not born yet, tell them that instead.
